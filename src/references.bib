  abstract  = {Citus is an open source distributed database engine for PostgreSQL that is implemented as an extension. Citus gives users the ability to distribute data, queries, and transactions in PostgreSQL across a cluster of PostgreSQL servers to handle the needs of data-intensive applications. The development of Citus has largely been driven by conversations with companies looking to scale PostgreSQL beyond a single server and their workload requirements. This paper describes the requirements of four common workload patterns and how Citus addresses those requirements. It also shares benchmark results demonstrating the performance and scalability of Citus in each of the workload patterns and describes how Microsoft uses Citus to address one of its most challenging data problems.},

  abstract  = {This paper presents RisingWave, a new cloud-native streaming database under development. RisingWave's mission is to democratize stream processing: to make stream processing simple, affordable, and accessible. To achieve that, RisingWave treats streams as first-class citizens in a database and uses PostgreSQL compatible SQL interface. Users can create their streaming analytical task by defining materialized views. The views are incrementally maintained in the RisingWave streaming engine, and are ready to be queried directly without exporting to an external system. RisingWave is designed for the cloud. The tiered architecture decouples its components such that each component scales independently to fully leverage the cloud infrastructure and reduce the cost. We demonstrate how RisingWave can simplify users' real-time analytical missions in the modern data stack.},

We define a small programming language whose types are abelian groups equipped with linear inverses, and provide both a standard and a differential denotational semantics. The two semantics coincide in that the differential semantics is the differential of the standard one. M{\"o}bius inversion, a well-known idea from combinatorics, permits a systematic treatment of various operators and constructs.},
