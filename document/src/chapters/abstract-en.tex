  The ticket sales process for high-demand events, such as concerts, does not always run smoothly. A unique characteristic of this problem is that the sale of a single seat is highly contested. Furthermore, the system must handle an extremely large number of queries requesting ticket availability. On the other hand, system stability is also a crucial aspect of maintaining ticket sales continuity. Therefore, this research aims to explore what optimizations are suitable for this system. The first optimization is to improve transaction rate scaling by using a distributed relational database, such as CitusData and YugabyteDB. The baseline for this system is a PostgreSQL cluster. Subsequently, order processing flow control is implemented by rejecting requests that meet certain criteria. Orders are then processed asynchronously with a maximum number of concurrent order processing at one time. In load testing with 10,000 to 15,000 virtual users for 10 to 15 minutes, the PostgreSQL cluster showed excellent results with low latency and efficient resource usage. CitusData had acceptable results with higher latency and resource usage. YugabyteDB performed poorly with much higher resource usage and an unacceptable failure rate. On the other hand, the flow control scheme on the PostgreSQL cluster variant performed well under the same load. Rejecting order requests earlier reduces the load on the database, especially in cases of orders being rejected because they were already booked by other users. The use of a queue showed lower latency for locking queries, although its implementation caused much higher overall latency and the test load was not high enough to show a significant difference.
