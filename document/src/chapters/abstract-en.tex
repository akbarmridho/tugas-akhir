  The process of selling tickets for high-demand events like concerts does not always run smoothly. A unique characteristic of this problem is that the sale of a single seat is highly contested. Additionally, the system must serve a very large number of requests for ticket availability. On the other hand, system stability is also a crucial aspect to maintain the continuity of ticket sales. Therefore, this research aims to explore what optimizations are suitable for this system.

  The first optimization is to improve transaction rate scaling by using a distributed relational database, such as CitusData and YugabyteDB. The baseline for this system is a PostgreSQL cluster. Furthermore, the flow control of order processing is managed by rejecting requests that meet certain criteria. Orders are then processed according to the system's capacity.

  The test results show that.
