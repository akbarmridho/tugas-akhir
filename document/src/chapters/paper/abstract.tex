	High-demand event ticketing systems require extreme throughput and stability under massive query loads and resource contention. This paper investigates and compares three architectural strategies to address these challenges. First, we evaluate the performance of distributed relational databases (CitusData and YugabyteDB) against a traditional PostgreSQL cluster as a benchmark. Second, we optimize high-volume ticket availability queries by storing aggregate data in Redis. Third, we evaluate a flow control scheme combining early request rejection and a queueing system to limit concurrent order processing and maintain database stability. Under load tests with up to 15,000 virtual users, the PostgreSQL cluster showed the best performance, achieving a processing rate of 466 requests/second with a P50 latency of 192-382 ms and efficient resource usage. CitusData delivered acceptable results but with approximately 2x higher latency, while YugabyteDB's performance was inadequate. The Redis caching strategy proved highly effective, serving up to 1,700 requests/second with an average latency of 2.5-4.5 ms, significantly reducing the database load. Furthermore, the early request rejection strategy successfully lowered the latency for rejected orders from over 1000 ms to under 100 ms. Our findings suggest that for this high-contention workload, a well-tuned monolithic PostgreSQL cluster, augmented with an in-memory store for read optimization and an intelligent early request rejection mechanism, provides a more robust and performant solution than the tested distributed database alternatives.
