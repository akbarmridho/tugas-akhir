	High-demand event ticketing systems require high throughput and stability under extreme query loads and seat contention. This paper investigates database and application-level optimizations to address these challenges. We evaluate the performance of a traditional PostgreSQL cluster against distributed SQL databases, specifically CitusData and YugabyteDB, for scaling transaction rates. Additionally, we introduce an asynchronous, concurrency-limited order processing flow control scheme designed to reduce database strain by rejecting invalid requests early. Under load tests with 10,000 to 15,000 virtual users, the baseline PostgreSQL cluster demonstrated superior performance with the lowest latency and most efficient resource utilization. In contrast, CitusData showed acceptable but higher latency, while YugabyteDB exhibited poor performance and an unacceptable failure rate. The flow control mechanism, when applied to the PostgreSQL cluster, proved highly effective, significantly reducing database load by pre-emptively filtering requests for unavailable tickets. Our findings suggest that for this specific high-contention workload, a well-tuned monolithic relational database combined with an intelligent application-level flow control strategy provides a more robust and efficient solution than the tested distributed database alternatives.
