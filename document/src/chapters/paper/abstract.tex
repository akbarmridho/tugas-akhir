	The ticket sales process for high-demand events, such as concerts, does not always run smoothly. The system must handle an extremely large number of queries requesting ticket availability, while system stability is also a crucial aspect. This research aims to explore suitable optimizations for this system. The first optimization improves transaction rate scaling using a distributed relational database, such as CitusData and YugabyteDB, with a PostgreSQL cluster as a baseline. Subsequently, order processing flow control is implemented by rejecting requests that meet certain criteria and processing orders asynchronously with a maximum number of concurrent processes.
